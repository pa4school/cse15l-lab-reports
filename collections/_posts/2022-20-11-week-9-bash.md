# Part 2. Example Output

- [https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-lab3](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-lab3), which has the same code as the starter from lab 3

![List methods lab 3](../../assets/images/2022/week9/list-methods-lab3.png)

- [https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-corrected](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-corrected), which has the methods corrected (I would expect this to get full or near-to-full credit)

![List methods corrected](../../assets/images/2022/week9/list-methods-corrected.png)

- [https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-compile-error](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-compile-error), which has a syntax error of a missing semicolon. Note that your job is *not* to fix this, but to decide what to do in your grader with such a submission!

![List methods compile error](../../assets/images/2022/week9/list-methods-compile-error.png)

- [https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-signature](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-signature), which has the types for the arguments of `filter` in the wrong order, so it doesn’t match the expected behavior.

# Part 3. Tracing Script

Choose `list-methods-signature` in the examples I showed in screenshot, and describe a trace of what your grade.sh does on that example.

To trace the script, describe:

For each line with a command, what its standard output and standard error are for this run, and whether its return code was zero or nonzero
For each line with an if statement, whether the condition was true or false, and why
Indicate each line that does not run (maybe because it is in an if branch that doesn’t evaluate, or after an early exit)
